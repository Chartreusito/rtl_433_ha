# RTL
Goal here is to have a single, auto discover script in its open repository. Will make it easier to add new devices.

This uses the master branch, and will continue doing so. 

The autodiscover script is forked and will be maintained here instead of the rtl_433. This will enable us to quickly get easily add to the autodiscover with more control over the process.

The 

The conf template supplied has not only the protocols and descriptions, but they are all currently disabled.
This way you can go and only select the ones you want, but still use the autodiscover script.

## todo

Put autodiscover script in /config/rtl_433/scripts (More tranperency and edits are important)

Make one add on, with maybe even a gui and ability to run the script when needed

Add more to the auto discover script. We know the community done more. PIRs and Contact sensors are what we want, and they were not in the previous script
